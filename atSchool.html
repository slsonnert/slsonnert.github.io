<h3>Use reusable sandwich bags if you bring your own lunch</h3>
</p>
<p>
Reusable sandwich bags are just as easy to use as plastic ziplock bags and they can be washed in the dishwasher for many uses.

<h3>Recycle and compost whatever you can from your school lunch </h3>
</p>
<p>
If you get school lunch and your school has recycling and/or compostable bins, sort your trash into the different bins.

<h3>Walk, bike, or take public transportation</h3>
</p>
<p>
Walking and biking are a better alternative to driving to school. If you do not want to walk or bike, you can also take public transportation instead of driving.
